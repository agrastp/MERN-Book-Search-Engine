# 21 MERN: Book Search Engine

## Description

 [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) <br>

  This is a MERN build Book Search Engine using Google Books API.  On login or signup, the user can make a search in the input section for genres or titles.  Book cards are rendered with a button to add to a Saved Book page.  The user can then go to their saved books at anytime to view books they would like to read.  Books can be deleted from the saved book page as well.  The use of local storage is used so that the users saved items will render each time they are logged in.
